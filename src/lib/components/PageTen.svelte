		A book like <span class="italic-serif">The Martian </span> couldn’t have been written back in
		the 1890s due to its reliance on modern, real-world technology for reference. And
		<span class="italic-serif">The War of the Worlds </span> would be a fundamentally different story
		if it was written today, as the cultural imagination of the time was shaped by radically different
		social circumstances and scientific understandings than the ones we enjoy in the 21st century.
