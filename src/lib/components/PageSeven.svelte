		The Martian (2011): Andy Weir really brought the “science” part of “science fiction” to his
		debut novel. The Martian is extremely technically accurate, chronicling one man’s survival on
		the planet Mars after being left stranded by a mission gone awry. It delves into detailed yet
		surprisingly engaging explanations of how the protagonist Mark Watney creates water by burning
		hydrogen gas, jerry-rigs antiquated electronics to re-establish communication with Earth, and
		generally engineers his continued survival against all odds.

		The technically-specific writing reflects the incredible advancement of human capabilities
		that’s taken place over just the last few decades. Humanity went from its first engine-powered
		flight (1903) to its first manned orbit (1961) to its first landing on the Moon (1969) in the
		space of less than a century. Weir’s writing in The Martian is incredibly reliant on using
		current, real-world technologies to imagine conflicts and progression within the narrative;
		without knowledge of those technologies, this book simply wouldn’t exist, or else it would exist
		fundamentally differently than it does: it would fall more into fantasy than science fiction.
