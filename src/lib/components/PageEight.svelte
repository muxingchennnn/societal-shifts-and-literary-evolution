		The technically-specific writing reflects the incredible advancement of human capabilities
		that’s taken place over just the last few decades. Humanity went from its first engine-powered
		flight (1903) to its first manned orbit (1961) to its first landing on the Moon (1969) in the
		space of less than a century. Weir’s writing is incredibly reliant on using current, real-world
		technologies to imagine conflicts and progression within the narrative; without knowledge of
		those technologies, this book simply wouldn’t exist, or else it would exist fundamentally
		differently than it does: it would fall more into fantasy than science fiction.
