		<span class="italic-serif">The War of the Worlds </span> (1897): H.G. Wells, the prolific and
		famed author of numerous science-fiction novels and short stories, drew heavily on humanity’s
		fear of the unknown in his narratives. <span class="italic-serif">The War of the Worlds </span>
		features an invasion by lifeforms from the planet Mars. Where
		<span class="italic-serif">The Martian </span> imagines realistically what could go wrong with technology
		that already exists, Wells’ imagination ran wild in the space left open by the gaps in our knowledge.

		At the time Wells was writing, there was quite a buzz about the possibility of canals on Mars-
		channels, presumably created by intelligent Martian life. Though the idea was challenged at the
		time, and was of course eventually definitively debunked, the idea that there may be
		technologically advanced life within our solar system undoubtedly sparked Wells’ imagination.

		He not only drew on the realm of contemporary scientific debate, but also the political and
		social climate of the moment. <span class="italic-serif">The War of the Worlds</span>, written
		just before the height of the British Empire, has been interpreted as a critique of colonial
		imperialism. The invading Martians land in England and attack the locals, disregarding the
		Earthlings’ attempts to communicate or surrender. It’s not too far a stretch to draw a parallel
		between the brutal colonial history of Great Britain and the violence wrought by the invading
		Martians.
