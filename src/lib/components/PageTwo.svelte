		Storytelling seems to be an innate part of being human. Children sing, dance, doodle, and <span
			class="font-[800] text-purple-500">tell stories</span
		>, all without being taught- put a group of kids together and in no time at all, they’ll be
		running around pretending to be kings and queens, cats and dogs, parents and firefighters.
	</p>
	<p>
		But what <span class="italic-serif">kinds </span>of stories do they tell? We might call them
		adventure stories- brave heroes infiltrating castles (
		<span class="italic-serif">treehouses</span>
		), defending their kingdom (
		<span class="italic-serif">playing tag or having a snowball fight</span>
		), and fighting dragons ( <span class="italic-serif">wrestling with the neighbor’s dog</span> ).
		Or perhaps there’s a great romance playing out on the playground- who doesn’t have a story about
		a friend who got “married” to their best friend when they were four? And of course we can’t forget
		that kids are the truest devotees of the horror genre, insisting their guardians check their closets
		and under their beds for boogeymen of all descriptions before they go to sleep at night.
	</p>
	<p>
		The labels we put on these stories, especially when we’re discussing published stories, are also
		called <span class="italic-serif">genres</span>.
	</p>
	<p>
		When those kids grow up, some of them might write books, go on to get them published, and
		perhaps eventually take their own children to the library to find a copy. Genre categorizations
		help librarians and library patrons alike find the kinds of books- the kinds of stories- they
		want to read.
