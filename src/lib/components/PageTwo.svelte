		Storytelling seems to be an innate part of being human. Children sing, dance, doodle, and tell
		stories, (make red) all without being taught- put a group of kids together and in no time at
		all, they’ll be running around pretending to be kings and queens, cats and dogs, parents and
		firefighters.
	</p>
	<p>
		But what kinds of stories do they tell? We might call them adventure stories- brave heroes
		infiltrating castles ( <span class="italic-sans">treehouses</span> ), defending their kingdom (playing
		tag or having a snowball fight), and fighting dragons (wrestling with the neighbor’s friendly dog).
		Or perhaps there’s a great romance playing out on the playground- who doesn’t have a story about
		a friend who got “married” to their best friend when they were four? And of course we can’t forget
		that kids are the truest devotees of the horror genre, insisting their guardians check their closets
		and under their beds for boogeymen of all descriptions before they go to sleep at night.
	</p>
	<p>
		The labels we put on these stories, especially when we’re discussing published stories, are also
		called <span class="italic-serif">genres</span>.
	</p>
	<p>
		When those kids grow up, some of them might write books, go on to get them published, and
		perhaps eventually take their own children to the library to find a copy. Genre categorizations
		help librarians and library patrons alike find the kinds of books- the kinds of stories- they
		want to read.
	</p>
	<p>
		The way we categorize stories has changed over the centuries, in large part because as society
		and technology develop, so too do the stories we tell.

Modern fantasy finds its roots in fairy tales and ghost stories of the sixteen and seventeen hundreds, which still lend both their 
whimsical and grotesque features to the genre today.
Romance never goes out of style! From Orpheus and Eurydice to Romeo and Juliette to Elizabeth Bennett and Mr. Darcy, love stories have been ubiquitous for 
thousands of years. 
Mary Shelley, author of the 1818 novel Frankenstein, is affectionately credited as the mother of science fiction. While there are a 
scattering of earlier stories by other authors, none rose to popularity in the way her story did. Today, it’s consistently among the top five most 
popular genres of fiction.
From alternate histories to historical romance to children’s history, historical fiction is a particularly broad genre.
